## Description
For this task I was asked to create a REACT portfolio that would be impproved upon as my newer projects are completed and newer technologies are learned. This project helped myself get more familiar with how REACT works with calling Import statements and exporting files where they need to be exported. After working on this project I understand better how both the front-end and the back-end of REACT come into play and how important it is to have a neat backend so front-end files are clean and presentable
